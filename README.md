# üí´ About Me:
Hello!, I'm Luis üòé, I'm currently a video editor specialized in vfx and in the cinematographic field with +2 years of experience being self-taught üî•. Since I entered the world of editing, the fact of the "How" and the "Why" in each fragment of film/series has always caught my attention. What do I mean by this? The simple fact of creating a composition and in it there are multiple effects that go on air so that the public can appreciate them, it is something that really fascinates me, the fact that every time I go into editing, creativity can flow in a thousand ways and among them, to achieve it. Actually, it is a feeling that cannot be described. ü§Ø‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>On the other hand, like everything in life, there are stages that culminate and just as they culminate, new ones begin. üè≥Ô∏è<br><br>In my case, it started from scratch, watching videos from the YT platform, the same process as editing, however, I chose to take a different path, that's where Goit-Latam comes in. An academy where he managed to apply and gain access to "Developer Full Stack". A totally different world üåê in which, every time, I find myself more immersed in it. A world where challenges and challenges are presented to move to the next level üî•.<br><br>Without more to say, I say goodbye ‚ù§Ô∏è.<br><br>Contact: jorgex4p@gmail.com<br><br>Success in your future projects ‚ù§Ô∏èüí§.
